# DreamCalculator
DreamCalculator calculates the period of time needed to reach a certain amount of money. 
Idea: We created an application where a user enters the amount of money he wants to save up. 
Depending on this, as well as on his income and expenses the app will calculate the period (in the best, optimal and the worst cases) in which the sum could be reached. 
In addition: the app allows to view the inserted data from the database.

What the project does?
Our project â€“ the application calculates the period of time needed to reach a certain amount of money. 

Why the project is useful?
In a short time a user can get an idea how long does it take to reach his dream - is it a month, two, a year or, perhaps, 
with a current level of income and expenses the dream is unreachable. Therefore, it clearly shows the time perspectives (the best, optimal or the worst options).
